## Code for generating and validating experimental setups described in our paper

Run the python file `setups.py` to generate the setups, plot a simple representation of the experimental setups (saved as png files), and print the resulting quantum states.

For each example, the value of the variable k determines the number of times the building block (multi-particle emitter emulated by pair-sources) is emitted. Increasing this number in the code generates larger setups with higher dimensions.
